            <span class="nav__counter">The Sun</span>
            <p class="nav__body">The Sun is numbered nineteen and usually shows a representation of the Sun with rays streaming from it. The Thoth deck version you see here is exceptional in that it is the rose of the Rose-Cross design which forms the Sun itself. The rays of light give the impression of spiralling out into the Universe. Within these rays are the signs of the Zodiac. There are usually a male and female - the same individuals we saw with the Lovers. They are the holy innocent children of God, bathed in the Sun's rays.The Sun conveys a sense of fertility and bounty. It is concerned with the turn of the years, cycles of birth, life, death and rebirth. This is a very warm and happy card. After the Moon opened up new doors, the Sun comes up to light the way forward. We have new hope and belief. This is a card of healing, especially on an emotional level. It promises hope and happiness, along with a new sense of safeness, protection and recovery. We are at the place where miracles happen.</p>

          <a href="#section4">
            <span class="nav__counter">The Star</span>
            <p class="nav__body">The Star (or Daughter of the Firmament) is numbered seventeen and is probably the most optimistic and beautiful card in the deck. A beautiful young woman, often naked, is depicted pouring water from a jug into the ground or into a pool by her feet. There are stars in the sky above her. Stars have long been seen as symbols of hope, regeneration, vision and new life. When this card appears, you know somehow that life is just about to become easier and brighter. Life's forces combine to assist rather than hinder. Here is the truth about our power - we can join the solid earth of material existence with the flowing waters of spirit and create within ourselves a Universe. We have removed self-criticism and concentrated instead on our skills and strengths. When we regard ourselves with love, humour, tenderness and sympathy, we access the God and Goddess within and we are transformed.</p>

        <li role="presentation">
          <a href="#section5">
            <span class="nav__counter">The Magician</span>
            <p class="nav__body">The Magician is normally numbered one and is sometimes called the Magus. The Magician is usually depicted as a powerful adept, a master of the four elements. He is able to shift events in his favour - to make the World change around him according to his Will. He is highly skilled, highly powerful and hence a highly dynamic and charismatic figure. He is that part of us which we harness to control our own lives. When we are the Magician we make what we want happen. However, you can be sure that we receive exactly what we ask for - "be careful what you pray for, you might just get it"! The Magician knows where to throw the pebble into the pool of the Universe in order to get exactly the ripples he wants. If we choose happiness and joy and put our Will behind them, that is what we can achieve.</p>

        <li role="presentation">
          <a href="#section6">
            <span class="nav__counter">Adjustment</span>
            <p class="nav__body">Justice (or Adjustment) is numbered eight in some decks and eleven in others. We see a female figure, holding the scales to represent the balance between good and evil, right and wrong within our lives. She also holds the sword which knights us or which claims retribution. Justice is the supreme Judge. Here we see the effects of Karma, the idea that everything we do today has either a positive or negative effect upon our future. Every dark thought or deed weighs against us, balanced out (hopefully) by every good deed and loving thought. We can be angels and we can be demons, it is our choice. We shape our futures by what we do and think now. If we stop blaming other people, or forces, if things go wrong then we take control of our own lives. Justice shows us that the natural cycles of the Universe will reflect back upon us exactly what we expect - so expect joy and happiness!</p>

        <li role="presentation">
          <a href="#section7">
            <span class="nav__counter">The Tower</span>
            <p class="nav__body">The Tower is numbered sixteen and shows a tower struck by lightning, with raging fires within and the top of the tower falling. There are usually figures falling, head-first, from the ruins. The Tower shows us a basic fact of spiritual life - the power of the Gods can strike unexpectedly to break down all the long-established patterns and assumptions that we have taken for granted for so long. Sometimes our limited vision of reality blocks our understanding and perception of truth. We begin to believe that the Tower - which we have been building higher and higher in order to reach the Gods - is the only reality. A cataclysmic force is needed to destroy this fantasy so as to allow us to recognise the powers which surround us. When this happens we must react with hope, letting go of our fears. The highest truths can now be realised.</p>

        <li role="presentation">
          <a href="#section8">
            <span class="nav__counter">The Empress</span>
            <p class="nav__body">The Empress is numbered three and symbolises one half of a perfect polarity - the Emperor being the other side of the balance. From the purity of the High Priestess we move naturally onwards to the Empress' sense of bounty and fertility. She represents the Mother Goddess, fulfilling her part in the eternal cycle of creation. The Empress holds the power to steadily and determinedly rebuild, renew, nurture and nourish. She has an unquenchable and generous courage, responding instantly when she sees a need to defend. Her realm is built of love, fertility and warmth. When the Empress holds us we are once again in the sure safety of the infant at its mother's breast. She also represents unconditional love - making no demands and setting no conditions. If we allow her love to flow through us then we too can become a pure spring through which the Universe flows. Only our fears stand between us and the Goddess.</p>
